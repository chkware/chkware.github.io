### Motivation

APIs power modern businesses, connecting web apps to services from multiple vendors. As integrations grow more complex, maintaining reliability becomes critical. Thatâ€™s why you need smarter, modular API testing toolsâ€”built for todayâ€™s fast-evolving ecosystem.

API automation is essential, but existing tools are complex and require significant learning. Setting up and maintaining automated tests takes time and often demands programming expertise for customization. You need a faster, simpler solutionâ€”designed for effortless setup and minimal learning curves.

API testing tools are costlyâ€”not just in licensing but also in setup and maintenance. Free tools cover only basic use cases, while advanced features come with complex licensing and minimal community support. With fewer open-source alternatives, finding a scalable, affordable solution is harder than ever. Thatâ€™s where an open, community-driven tool can fill the gap.

These limitations make existing tools less scalable for real-world use. Effective API testing requires:

- Mastery of specific programming languages, slowing onboarding.
- Managing a complex software stack increases the risks of side effects.
- Careful test code design upfront, or maintenance becomes a nightmare.

The result? Slower adoption and higher long-term costs. You need a solution that simplifies testing without the overhead.

Itâ€™s clearâ€”the current state of API testing needs improvement. Thatâ€™s why we created CHKware: a smarter, faster, and scalable solution designed to simplify API automation.
