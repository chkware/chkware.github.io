This page describes some key concepts before you use **chkware**. There are two parts to this tool.

1. The command line tool that you can run as `chk`
2. The test specification files: those you write in YAML, in supported DSL.

### Test specifications

Test specification files are written in YAML. So, before you start writing any specs, you should have a proper introduction to YAML, if you do not have already. Here is a fine [YAML cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/yaml) to grasp some knowledge.

> In the future evolution path of **chkware** we are going to introduce more and more specification options and specification types and versions.

Letâ€™s first get you introduced to the (till now) only specification format supported by **chkware**, the Http specification format. As mentioned in the introduction page **_Create reusable offline http request specification._**, the Http specification format is how you express a Http request format. Following are some examples by case to write Http specification file.

### Reference

Following yaml blocks can be used to identify different section of a Http specification file.

```yaml
---
request:
  # valid URL
  url: https://reqres.in/api/users/2

  # for query string or url parameters
  url_params:
    one: 1
    two: true

  # http method to use
  method: GET # or POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD

  # send requst headers
  # add any numbers of headers
  # Causion: some values or keys need to be wrapped with single (') or double (") quote
  headers:
    User-Agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36'
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate'
    accept: '*/*'

  # send authentication header.
  # two supported type: auth[bearer], auth[basic]:

  # auth[bearer] example
  auth[bearer]:
    token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

  # auth[basic] example
  auth[basic]:
    username: Some_USER
    password: 'Some-P@$$W03D'

  # send request body with the request

  # no body to send
  body[none]: ~

  # to send application/x-www-form-urlencoded form enctype
  body[form]:
    'var 1': 'var str 1'
    var-2: 'var str 2'
    # note: this will just pass filepath as value
    var_3: file:///home/username/.vimrc

  # to upload file as part of body use multipart/form-data like
  body[form-data]:
    'var 1': 'var str 1'
    var-2: 'var str 2'
    # note this will actually upload a file
    # we use file protocol (file://) scheme to identify a file
    var_3: file:///home/username/.vimrc
    var4: file:///home/username/Documents/CID-25601.IpPhone.rtf

  # to send plain text
  body[text]: 'Plain text here'

  # to pass as json to body pass a yaml object like
  body[json]: { user_id: 32, roll_no: 1, class: 2, name: 'Student name' }

  # to pass a xml as body use a yaml literal block
  body[xml]: |

### Examples

Following are the examples with HTTP GET method. Although all these example are still valied for POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD method as well.

#### Minimal request

```yaml
---
request:
  url: https://example.org/api/path
  method: GET
```

#### Request with query string

```yaml
---
# put variables on the path
request:
  url: https://example.org/api/path?foo=bar&two=2
  method: GET
```

or you can also do like:

```yaml
---
# put variables as url_params entry
request:
  url: https://example.org/api/path
  method: GET
  url_params:
    foo: bar
    two: 2
```

#### Request with query string and header

```yaml
---
request:
  url: https://example.org/api/resource/action
  method: GET

  url_params:
    foo: bar
    two: 2

  headers:
    User-Agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36'
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
```

#### Request with basic authentication header

```yaml
---
request:
  url: https://example.org/api/resource/id
  method: GET

  headers:
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Content-Type: application/json

  auth[basic]:
    username: Some_USER
    password: 'Some-P@$$W03D'
```

    cover_photo: file:///home/username/student-cvphoto-01.png
```

#### Request with XML in body

Following example will submit a plain html form POST with encoding type `multipart/form-data`
