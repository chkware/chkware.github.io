Follow the steps to do a manual release on PyPi.

- Please confirm that [Python 3.11.x](https://www.python.org/downloads) with [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today) is installed and setup on this machine

- Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chkware/cli.git cli-wheel
    ```

- Change to the directory

    ```bash
    cd cli-wheel
    ```

- Update version number on `setup.cfg`

    ```ini
    version = 0.X.X
    ```

- Update version number on `chk/console/main.py`

    ```python
    """v0.X.X | supported version strings: 0.7.2, ..."""
    ```

- Update *docs/CHANGELOG.md* with the release *0.X.X* information

- Make directory for local *virtualenv* setup

    ```bash
    mkdir ./.venv
    ```

- Install all required packages

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

- Install all required packages for build and push to PyPI

    ```

- Use the environment's python to build

    ```bash
    pipenv run python -m build --wheel --sdist
    ```

    ```bash
    pipenv run twine upload dist/*
    ```

- Publish and push an annotated tag
