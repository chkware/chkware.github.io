### Introduction

API quality test, and automation management is not easy to develop, and maintain. It requires multitude of knowledge of programming libraries, business scenarios, infrastructure details, etc - unless you use ***CHKware***.

*CHKware* (say, **Check-Ware**) is a low-code API quality testing, and automation tool. It helps you write accurate, robust, and expressive feature tests for your API in less time than usual.

🏎️💨 .. [**Get started**](/docs/quick-start) here.

### Setup

With [**Python 3.13**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [**Pipx**](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/#install-pipx) pre-installed, run following in your terminal to get *CHKware* installed.

```bash
pipx install chk
```

> See other ways to install ***CHKware*** in [setup guide](/docs/setup).

This will install a command called `chk`. **`chk`** is a console command that runs your test configuration written in YAML.

To verify installation, run:

```shell
chk --help
```
